# Peppol-Reporting
This library is used to support OpenPeppol Reporting Specifications i.e. reporting of End User data and Transaction Statistics by Service Provider to OpenPeppol.
The reporting requirements towards Service Providers (SPs) are divided into two areas: reporting about End User data and reporting about Transaction Statistics.
